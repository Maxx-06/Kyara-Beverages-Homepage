## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks Used

  _This site is built using pure CSS without any CSS framework._
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – for scroll-triggered and entrance animations.

## ✨ Animations

- The website includes smooth entrance animations using **GSAP**.
- Animations are applied to elements as they appear in the viewport, enhancing user engagement.
- **ScrollTrigger** from GSAP is used to trigger animations on scroll.
